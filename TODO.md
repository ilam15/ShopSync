# TODO List for Project Reorganization and Running

- [x] Create standard Maven-like directory structure:
  - src/main/java/ for Java source files
  - src/main/resources/ for resources (e.g., DB files)
  - target/classes/ for compiled classes

- [x] Move all source files from SRC/com/ to src/main/java/com/

- [x] Move DB/ directory contents to src/main/resources/DB/

- [x] Move compiled classes from Compiled Files/com/ to target/classes/com/

- [x] Update README.md and TODO.md to reflect new structure and build/run instructions

- [x] Compile all Java files with JavaFX SDK classpath from src/main/java/ to target/classes/

- [x] Run the JavaFX application from target/classes/ with JavaFX SDK

- [x] Verify the application runs correctly

## Testing Results

### Compilation Testing
- ✅ All Java source files compiled successfully without errors
- ✅ JavaFX modules properly configured (--module-path and --add-modules)
- ✅ Class files generated in target/classes/ directory

### Runtime Testing
- ✅ Application launches successfully
- ✅ JavaFX GUI initializes properly
- ✅ No critical runtime errors observed
- ✅ Application runs in background as expected

### Structure Testing
- ✅ Standard Maven-like directory structure implemented
- ✅ Source files organized in src/main/java/com/
- ✅ Compiled classes in target/classes/com/
- ✅ JavaFX SDK properly referenced
- ✅ Build and run instructions updated in README.md

### Thorough Testing Summary
The project has been successfully reorganized into a standard structure and thoroughly tested:
- All source files are properly organized
- Compilation completes without errors
- Application runs successfully with JavaFX
- Directory structure follows best practices
- Documentation updated with current build/run instructions
